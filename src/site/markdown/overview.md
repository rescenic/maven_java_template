# Markdown

This page lives in the /src/markdown directory.

The menu link to the page is added via the /src/site.xml file.

## Maven

Here's the link to
the [Maven Doxia plugin for Markdown](http://maven.apache.org/doxia/doxia/doxia-modules/doxia-module-markdown/index.html)
. The [Doxia overview page shows using Markdown](http://maven.apache.org/doxia/references/index.html) by default.

Unfortunately, there's not a lot of documentation there - but at least you have this project showing you a simple
example!

These Markdwon files will automatically be turned into .html files with the matching name. For example, this overview.md
file gets turned into overview.html.

Here's an example of linking to a [second markdown page](second.html).

## Editors

What's nice about this is that you can use one of a very large number of Markdown editors for writing your Maven
documentation. Just search for Markdown editor and your platform on Google and you should find several nice ones.

[IntelliJ has a pretty nice Markdown editor](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/markdown.html#code-blocks).
